<div class="steps">
    <h1>Unique solutions for unique businesses</h1>
    <p>Every business is different. That's why we design and deliver a different solution for each client we work with.</p>
    <p><strong>We follow a simple four step process to get it right:</strong></p>

    <ol class="four-steps">
        <li class="step-1">
            <p><strong>Understanding your needs</strong> We take the time to understand your business, customers, objectives, timeframe and budget.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="step-2">
            <p><strong>Proposing a solution</strong> Given the above, we devise a strategy designed to deliver the best results for your business. This may include several solutions, or referrals to other businesses to cover niche areas. Our honesty policy ensures we always give you the best advice, even if it means directing your business elsewhere.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="step-3">
            <p><strong>Making it happen</strong> We work with you to deliver the project. Some clients want to have a very hands on role throughout this process, others prefer us to take care of everything. In either case, we work our hardest to ensure the end result is of the highest quality.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="step-4">
            <p><strong>Management &amp; maintenance</strong> Depending on the nature of your project, we follow up with training to help you manage your website, or accurately analyse your campaign's/website's performance.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

                <h3>Websites that work</h3>
                <p>Whatever type of website you require, we have the skills and experience to make it a reality.</p>
                <p>Our design and development solutions are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Carefully tailored to meet your requirements</strong> — we recognise that your business is unique and believe that your website should be too. Unlike some of our competitors, we don’t make you choose from a bunch of generic templates; instead, each of our client sites is lovingly handcrafted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Designed for maximum efficiency</strong> — whether you want to generate more leads, increase sales, or just get your message across, we understand that your website needs to <em>perform</em>, as well as look good. Our online marketing experience puts us in a great position to deliver fantastic results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Built for longevity</strong> — we hand-code all our sites to the latest standards, including HTML5 and CSS3. This makes them faster, more secure, easier to maintain and accessible to the widest range of modern browsers and devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free from 'lock in'</strong> — we build our websites using open-source technologies, and provide you with all of your files upon project completion. Our clients stay with us because they love our work, so we feel no need to 'lock them in' with proprietary software or by tying them to a custom in-house CMS.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Conversion Optimisation</h2>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="flt-left conversion-block-1 w-gutter">
                <h3>Improve your website to generate more business</h3>
                <p>Conversion optimisation is the process of improving your website to generate more leads and/or sales for your business.</p>
                <p>It requires a thorough understanding of your business alongside an in-depth analysis of your current campaign's performance statistics.</p>
                <p>We then apply our knowledge of marketing, usability and industry best practices to help increase your conversion rate.</p>
                <p>We have a number of strategies to help your website or campaign perform better, but these are by far the most commonly appointed:</p>
            </div>
            <img alt="conversion optimisation" class="conversion-block-2 flt-right" src="/assets/img/conversion-graph.png">

            <div class="clear"></div>

            <div class="landing-pages flt-left w-gutter">
                <h3>Landing pages</h3>
                <p>Landing pages are one page lead generation websites designed for specific marketing campaigns (i.e. an email or adwords campaign).</p>
                <p>By sending your prospective buyers to a 'landing page' instead of your main website, you can tailor the message to that particular audience.</p>
                <p>Landing pages are designed to:</p>

                <ul class="tick">
                    <li>Deliver a strong, lean marketing message that differentiates you from your competition</li>
                    <li>Include a prominent 'call to action', urging your users to submit an enquiry</li>
                    <li>Be highly relevant to the search term, ad, or marketing campaign they are receiving traffic from</li>
                    <li>Establish trust &amp; credibility with your prospective customer</li>
                    <li>Address customer doubts and remove enquiry 'road blocks'</li>
                </ul>

                <p>More often than not, the combination of a focussed message and the correct implementation of the above results in a higher rate of enquiry and an increased return on your online marketing investment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="conversion-testing flt-right">
                <h3>Conversion testing</h3>
                <p>Conversion testing works by sending a portion of your visitors to an alternative variation of a webpage, to find out if this page generates a better result.</p>
                <p>A 'better result' could be a higher rate of enquiry, more products being added to a shopping cart, or a higher rate of purchase.</p>
                <p>Tests are set up in specialist software that measures the new page's performance against the original.</p>
                <p>Once one page is determined the 'winner' (and statistical significance is reached), this variation goes on to be the new base variation for the next test. In this manner, the performance of your page increases over time.</p>
                <p>There are several software solutions available that make the technical process of setting up a test child's play. Where the real specialisation lies is in understanding when, what and where to test. Common testing parameters include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Headlines</li>
                    <li>Images</li>
                    <li>Calls to action (positioning, colour and wording of purchase buttons and/or enquiry forms)</li>
                    <li>Body copy / text</li>
                </ul>
