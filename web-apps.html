            <h2>Case Study: BPCLEtool</h2>
            <p>Working with Darcy Associates, Python Charmers and the Victorian Department of Health, we helped to design and develop a web application to be used by hundreds of health services throughout Victoria.</p>

                    <h3>BPCLEtool</h3>
                    <p>The BPCLEtool concept was developed by Darcy Associates to help Victorian health organisations rate themselves against the <a href="http://www.health.vic.gov.au/placements/resources/index.htm">BPCLE framework</a>.</p>
                    <p>We helped transform a Microsoft Excel prototype of the tool into a feature-rich modern HTML5 web application.</p>

                    <h3>Designing the User Experience</h3>
                    <p>We worked with Darcy Associates to understand the application's requirements and design an optimal user experience.</p>
                    <p>Wireframing and user acceptance tests allowed us to validate key design concepts throughout the project.</p>
                    <p>The result was a clean and simple user interface and aesthetic design.</p>

                    <p>Working as part of the Python Charmers team, our role included project management, design and backend development.</p>
                    <p>Core technologies used to build the application include the Django web framework, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.</p>

        <p>The team at Kabu Creative has shown great creativity in the development of the new online BPCLEtool.</p>
        <p>We needed a practical mechanism to assist with the implementation of the BPCLE Framework and the BPCLEtool exceeds those requirements.</p>
        <p>The Kabu Creative team was flexible in their approach - listening and responding to requirements and feedback.</p>
        <p>Stakeholders have been very impressed with the tool's innovative functionality and user-friendly interface.</p>
