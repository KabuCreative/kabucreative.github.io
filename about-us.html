        <h3>Small and flexible</h3>
        <p>As a small business we can deliver a more personal, flexible and responsive service than bigger agencies. This means that you always talk to the person who is working on your project from inception to launch, and beyond.</p>
        <p>And because youâ€™re not just another client on a long list, you can be sure that the success of your project is truly important to us.</p>

    <div class="w-gutter flt-left about-block">
        <h3>Relationship focused</h3>
        <p>We aim to build meaningful relationships with our clients. Doing so allows us to better understand your business and enables us to deliver a solution that is both relevant and effective.</p>
        <p>We always provide completely honest advice, even if it means referring your business elsewhere. We strive for clarity and transparency at all times.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flt-left about-block">
        <h3>Business orientated</h3>
        <p>We understand that the value of a project is determined by the return it provides to your business.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, we take a user-centric approach to ensure that the work we complete on your behalf speaks to your target market.</p>
        <p>The end result? You stand out online and leave your competitors reeling.</p>
